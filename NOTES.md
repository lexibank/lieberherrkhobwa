This data set consists of lexical entries for one hundred
concepts, based on the concept lists of [Haspelmath and Tadmor (2009)](https://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Haspelmath-2009-1460) and [Swadesh (1971)](https://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Swadesh-1971-100).
Entries were translated into twenty-two languages of the Kho-Bwa subgroup of the Sino-Tibetan language family and were annotated with respect to cognacy information.

A tutorial accompanying this data set and providing first steps towards an analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/lexibank/phylogenetics-data-management-tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial.md).
